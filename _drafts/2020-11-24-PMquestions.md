I was on the lookout for a Product Manager (PM) job during arguably the worst time in a generation, the COVID-19 pandemic. I applied for many jobs and attended quite a few interviews. In this blog, I want to share my learnings and some nuances of attending the interview in India.

## 2. Behavioral questions
The next bang for your buck is the behavioral questions as they are the next popular type. As a bonus, preparing for these questions will give you the structure and content to answer other general questions on your background.

*What is this:* There are questions, where you would be asked for scenarios from your past experience, side project or personal life that showcase leadership skills , teamwork or talk about a challenge or failure you faced, etc. 

*What’s important:* The format in which you answer these questions is important. Equally important is the stories you say because it shows the wealth of experience you have had. 

*Recommended material:* [Cracking the PM Interview](https://amzn.to/2UQ2DqS) gives a useful guideline for preparing for behavioral questions. Follow the nugget first and S.A.R formats mentioned in the book and prepare your 5 key master stories.

*Some Behavioral Questions I faced:*

1. Introduce yourself (asked at all interviews)
2. What are 3 adjectives that define you?
3. What is your legacy at the company you worked the longest? 
4. What are the 3 things you look for in a company?

*Experience specific questions I faced:* (though they are not the typical Behavioral Questions, preparing for Behavioral Questions help answer these questions in a structured manner).

1. Explain your latest project.
2. For the user interviews that conducted for a previous project, what are the types of customers and personas that were interviewed?
3. What were some of the key metrics that were tracked at the start of the project and which you compared towards the end to make sure the project was successful?
4. What inputs did you consider to prioritize stories for the subsequent releases after the first launch?
5. What did you do during your break from work?

## 3. Product and Design questions
*What is this:* Product and Design questions are those where you would be asked to design a new product, critique an existing app or website or discuss a product they share during the interview process. 

*What’s important:* Your approach is what is important. The interviewer would ask to you think aloud or share your screen so he/she can see your approach. For B2C companies, in addition to approach, innovative and uniques ideas that impress the interviewers is what would give you the extra edge.

*Recommended material:* Practice the CIRCLES method and the Design criteria in Decode and Conquer for answering the Product and Design questions.

*Product & Design questions I faced:*

1. You are a consultant recruited by an large MNC to help reduce stress and improve collaboration of its employees who are undergoing tremendous stress from the long working hours and the new open office culture. Employees use the ping-pong tables installed on each floor to take breaks.

*Additional information:*

* You would be given 90 mins to work on the case study. Your screen should be shared during this time so the interviewer can see your approach. At the end of the 90 mins, please provide your solution along with a wireframe of the solution.
* You would have the opportunity to interview a user, business sponsor, buddy PM and product designer. 
* The emphasis is on the approach taken to solve the case study.

## 4. Case Study questions
*What is this:* Case Study questions are those where you would be given a business scenario and asked you specific questions on that scenario.

*Recommended material:* In my experience, you could be answer these questions by using clues from past experience and logical thinking. However, I recommend going through the common problems and causes mentioned in Cracking the PM Interview as it gives some ideas which are otherwise difficult to come up with yourself during a stressful interview. 

*Some Case Study questions I faced:*

1. Imagine you are the PM for Uber. You notice that cabs are not getting rides from airport back to the city. How would you solve this problem? What data would you look at to see what might be the issue?
2. Imagine you are the PM for Flipkart which is merging with Walmart. What would be some of the requirements to list Walmart products in the Flipkart website?  How would be the ranking and blending algorithm to be used to list the products? What would be some requirements for customer feedback when the customer places an order for a Walmart product in the Flipkart website? Imagine in future, the 2 systems are to be integrated. What are some parameters you would use to decide which system would stay and which one would be made redundant. 

## 5. Estimation questions
I have attended PM interviews for 7 firms in India so far and I have never been asked an estimation question and I have not known anyone who has been asked an estimation question. So if you are short of time and if you want to skip preparing for a question, this would be the one. But if you can prepare, it would boost your confidence as you know that you have everything covered. 

*What is this:* Mostly hypothical questions, such as how many gold balls would fit into a school bus.

*Recommended material:* I recommend Cracking the PM Interview as this book makes these questions seems a little less intimidating. 

## 6. Cloud based questions
If you are seeking a Cloud PM role, these questions are one of the most critical and would be at #2 in this list. Given the significance of Cloud technology now, these questions are quite important so even if the Job Description does not specifically mention it, make sure you know the basics at a minimum.

*What is this:* Mostly hypothical questions, such as how many gold balls would fit into a school bus.

*Recommended material:* I have found this free course on [Introduction to Cloud Computing](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:IBM+CC0101EN+2T2020/course/) helpful in answering basic Cloud based questions. You can also read my blogposts on [basics of cloud computing](https://sheia.github.io/2020/09/30/cloudcomputing.html), [how emerging technologies are supported by the cloud](https://sheia.github.io/2020/10/03/cloudcomputingandemergingtech.html) and [virtualization](https://sheia.github.io/2020/11/07/virtualization.html). 


*Cloud related questions I faced:*

1. What is unique about the cloud?
2. What are some unique challenges with cloud?
3. Assume you are the CEO of a cloud based start-up. Create a business plan to present to your investors showing the value and costs from using cloud.
4. What is the difference between a platform and an application?
5. Imagine you are the PM for a group creating APIs. What would be some of the requirements you would be writing?
6. What are the authentications you would implement as a PM for a team creating APIs.

*Some other questions I faced:* You don’t need a lot of preparation to answer these if you have past PM work experience. 

*Sprint Management*

1. Explain how your sprints worked? Explain the various sprint ceremonies.
2. What formats do you write requirements in?
3. How do you prioritize the requirements?
4. What is your role as a product manager in the sprint planning meeting?
5. What part of the product manager role involves project management?

*Stakeholder Management*

1. How do you handle multiple stakeholders when all of them demand their requirements be prioritized?
