[Jakob Nielsen](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/author/jakob-nielsen/) coined the 10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design in 1994. They are called "heuristics" because they are broad rules of thumb and not specific usability guidelines.

These heuristics were formalized 25 years ago and is so common in products around us today, that we have started taken them for granted. And so, it is even more important to follow them now than ever before, as these experiences are now deeply ingrained in customer experience.

In this post, I explore these 10 heuristics with modern day examples. 

## 1. Visibility of system status
> The system should always keep users informed about what is going on, through appropriate feedback within reasonable time.

##### What does it mean? 
Sometimes this feedback would be persistent or always visible such as the battery life or the wifi connection indcator. At other tiems, this feedback would be triggered by a user behavior such as on click of a button. While it is not required to make all the backend system details visible to the user, giving feedback gives users the feeling that they are in control, avoids confusion among the users and helps them make decisions. It gives confirmation to the user that his/her action was recognised and the system is working on the request. It makes a system reliable and predictable which in turn creates trust.

##### Example

| <span style="font-family:Papyrus; font-size:.6em;">A browser indicating that it is loading a page</span>|

## 2. Match between system and the real world

> The system should speak the users' language, with words, phrases and concepts familiar to the user, rather than system-oriented terms. Follow real-world conventions, making information appear in a natural and logical order.

##### What does it mean? 
Lean towards using words and ideas familiar to the user instead of using marketing jargon and technical terms. Also the experience should align with what the user is familiar in the real-world. Otherwise, it will add to the cognitive load on the user to make the intepretaton and cause confusion.

Skeuomorphic web design entails designing a digital experience to match a physical experience, both in visual and interaction.

##### Example 
Amazon Kindle is a popular example of Skeuomorphic web design. In a physical book, the reader can turn pages, highlight text and bookmark pages. All these features are built into the experience of the e-reader, giving the user an experience similar to reading a physical book.

## 3. User control and freedom

> Users often choose system functions by mistake and will need a clearly marked "emergency exit" to leave the unwanted state without having to go through an extended dialogue. Support undo and redo.

##### What does it mean? 
Giving easy exit options forsters freedom and confidence in the user to try out something new. They know that if the action they take was not as per expectation, they can easily go back.

##### Example

|:--:| 
| <span style="font-family:Papyrus; font-size:.6em;">The back and forward buttons gives confidence to the user to explore</span>|

## 4. Consistency and standards

> Users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing. Follow platform conventions.

##### What does it mean? 
Jakob's law can help us understand why following convention is important. Jakob's law states that "People spent most of their time on sites other than yours".

There are times when one does break the convention and that's when one has discovered a better design. The trade-off here would be the improved user experience from this new design vs forcing the users to learn something new. If the benefit is not substantial, it is better to stick to the standards.

##### Example 

|![](/img/posts/10-heuristics-4.png)| 
|:--:| 
| <span style="font-family:Papyrus; font-size:.6em;">The convention in ecommerce sites is to place the shopping cart in the top right-hand corner</span>|

## 5. Error prevention

> Even better than good error messages is a careful design which prevents a problem from occurring in the first place. Either eliminate error-prone conditions or check for them and present users with a confirmation option before they commit to the action.

##### What does it mean? 
The system should be designed such that it helps the user avoid error.

In critical transactions such as in finance or security, it is worth asking the user for a confirmation before acting on a user request. For example if the user places a fund transfer request, it is worth interuppting the user and asking for a re-confirmation before doing the transaction.

##### Example 

If the reply and reply-all buttons are placed too close to each other without much distinction between the 2 buttons, there is a high chance that the user will click reply-all instead of reply and send the reply to the entire distribution list by mistake.

## 6. Recognition rather than recall

> Minimize the user's memory load by making objects, actions, and options visible. The user should not have to remember information from one part of the dialogue to another. Instructions for use of the system should be visible or easily retrievable whenever appropriate.


## 7. Flexibility and efficiency of use

> Accelerators — unseen by the novice user — may often speed up the interaction for the expert user such that the system can cater to both inexperienced and experienced users. Allow users to tailor frequent actions.



## 8. Aesthetic and minimalist design

> Dialogues should not contain information which is irrelevant or rarely needed. Every extra unit of information in a dialogue competes with the relevant units of information and diminishes their relative visibility.



## 9. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors

> Error messages should be expressed in plain language (no codes), precisely indicate the problem, and constructively suggest a solution.


## 10. Help and documentation

> Even though it is better if the system can be used without documentation, it may be necessary to provide help and documentation. Any such information should be easy to search, focused on the user's task, list concrete steps to be carried out, and not be too large.
