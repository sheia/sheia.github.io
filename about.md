### About Me.

I am Product Manager with over 14+ years of industry experience working in the US and India. I hold an MBA from Indian Institute of Management, Bangalore and a Btech degree from College Of Engineering Trivandrum. I have worked for companies such Adobe, HSBC, Deutsche Bank, Citibank and Ameriprise Financial.

I blog about Product Management, User Experience and Technology - from basics to the greatest and latest.

I derive energy, motivation, and purpose from applying new technologies and simple, intuitive design to solve customer problems and improve the overall customer experiences.
