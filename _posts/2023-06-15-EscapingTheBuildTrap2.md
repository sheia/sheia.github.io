##  What does a great product manager do?


* The most important role of a PM is to work with the team to create value that satisfies both customer and business needs. 
* A PM should be able to interface with several stakeholders such as business, technology, design, etc to develop the solution.

> PMs are not experts in technology or business; they are experts in product management.

* The PM should be able to balance the inputs from all stakeholders and decide what is best for the product.

There are various levels in the product management organization depending on the amount of tactical, strategic and operational work involved.

|Tactical Work |Strategic Work|Operational Work|
| :----------: | :----------: | :----------: | 
| Building features and getting them out of the door| Envisioning the future state of the product and company and what it will take to get there| Creating a roadmap that connects the current state of the product to the future state and aligns the teams around the work |

The figure above shows how work starts to shift across roles.

##  How should product teams be organized?

For large organizations, the author recommends organizing teams around value streams. A value stream includes all activities needed to deliver value to the customer. For example, if there is an app to buy a car insurance, the app should be part of the larger division that holds the true value - the car insurance division.
