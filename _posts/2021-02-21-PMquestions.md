In my last [post](https://sheia.github.io/2020/11/24/PMinterview.html), I wrote about tips for cracking the Product Manager interview in India. This post is about some of the interview questions I have faced while looking for a Product Manager job in 2017 and then during 2020. The questions below are categorised based on the type of questions, about which I have written in details in my [previous post](https://sheia.github.io/2020/11/24/PMinterview.html).

## 1. Define yourself

1. Introduce yourself (asked at all interviews).
2. Why are you looking for a change?
3. Why did you apply to this job?
4. If I were to ask your current manager of your strong point and areas of improvement, what would that be?
5. If I were to talk to your colleagues from 2,3 years ago and ask them to tell me 3 of your qualities what would that be?
6. What would be your biggest stretch if you take up this job?

8. What is your legacy at the company you worked the longest?

## 3. Product and Design questions

1. You are a consultant recruited by an large MNC to help reduce stress and improve collaboration of its employees who are undergoing tremendous stress from the long working hours and the new open office culture. Employees use the ping-pong tables installed on each floor to take breaks.

*Additional information:*

* You would be given 90 mins to work on the case study. Your screen should be shared during this time so the interviewer can see your approach. At the end of the 90 mins, please provide your solution along with a wireframe of the solution.
* You would have the opportunity to interview a user, business sponsor, buddy PM and product designer. 
* The emphasis is on the approach taken to solve the case study.

## 4. Case Study questions

1. Imagine you are the PM for Uber. You notice that cabs are not getting rides from airport back to the city. How would you solve this problem? What data would you look at to see what might be the issue?
2. Imagine you are the PM for Flipkart which is merging with Walmart.
