[“Empowered: Ordinary People, Extraordinary Products”](https://www.amazon.com/EMPOWERED-Ordinary-Extraordinary-Products-Silicon/dp/111969129X/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1YSM5CU416IWL&keywords=empowered+marty+cagan&qid=1651547571&sprefix=Empow%2Caps%2C454&sr=8-1) By Marty Cagan is a highly recommended read for Product Leaders - leaders and managers of product management, product design and engineering. 
 
> "Leadership is about recognizing that there’s a greatness in everyone, and your job is to create an environment where that greatness can emerge.”
    
This book is all about identifying what makes such an environment.

This blog is the first part of a series of the key points from the book that resonated with me. 

###  Differences between how great product companies and the rest

1. Technology still being viewed as a necessary cost rather than enabling the core business. 

2. Lack of coaching of the people on the technology teams. 

3. Lack of the right staff and inablility to fill the gap

4. Lack of an inspiring product vision. 	
5. Team Topology such that the teams feel like they aren’t responsible for anything meaningful

6. Lack of Product Strategy
	
7. Not effective use to Team Objectives

8. The stakeholders and executives have little or no trust in the technology teams. 
	
9. The teams are not empowered to solve problems in ways customers love, yet work for the business. 

> The Product Manager is really a Project Manager, shepherding the backlog items through the process.


In most companies, the tech teams are not empowered product teams, they are feature teams.

|   | Feature Team     | Product Team     |
| :------------- | :----------: | -----------: |
| What are they        | Are cross-functional (with a product manager mainly doing project management, a product designer and some engineers)   | Are cross-functional (with a product manager doing project management, a product designer and some engineers)|
| How they operate        | Are assigned features and projects to build rather than problems to solve | Are assigned problems to solve and then empowered to come up with solutions that work |
| What is success | Are all about output and not business results | Are measured by outcome and are held accountable to results |

The author says that the answer is to move to empowered product teams. The book is about guiding the reader on how to make this transformation.
